		    <p style="color:black"><i>&emsp;Each month, one of our eight founding members will share a personal recommendation to offer you practical tips for exploring sciences or making the most of life in Bologna.<br/>
			    &emsp;This month, it’s <b>Raissa</b>’s turn, who is a member of the <b>study committee</b>.<br/>
			    &emsp;She’s sharing insights on a thought-provoking movie about in vitro fertilization and commercial surrogacy. Rather than celebrating scientific advancements, the movie focuses on the complexities and ethical dilemmas behind reproductive technology and challenges us to consider who truly benefits from these medical breakthroughs and who bears the weight of their consequences.</i></p>
		    <center><p><b>&emsp;Film Recommendation - from Raissa:<br/>
			    ‘Joy’ (2018), directed by Sudabeh Mortezai</b></p></center>

                    </div>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;When we think about <b>in vitro fertilization (IVF)</b>, it’s usually as a medical success story—science helping people start families. But <b>Joy (2018), directed by Sudabeh Mortezai</b>, takes a different approach. Instead of focusing on the parents or the doctors, it turns the spotlight on the women whose bodies make these treatments possible.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;The film follows Joy, a <b>woman navigating the world of commercial surrogacy</b>, where <b>hope and opportunity collide with power imbalances and difficult choices</b>.<br/>
			&emsp;It doesn’t present IVF as good or bad, but instead asks us to think about the bigger picture—who has access to these treatments, who benefits, and who is left with the hardest burdens.</p>
		    <p style="color:black">&emsp;What struck me most about Joy is how <b>quietly powerful</b> it is: it doesn’t rely on dramatic storytelling, yet every moment feels heavy with unspoken questions.<br/>
			    &emsp;As someone interested in the <b>intersection of science and society</b>, I found it fascinating how the film shows both the promise of reproductive technology and the complicated realities behind it. For anyone curious about the human side of medical advancements, Joy offers a perspective we don’t often see—but should.</p>

                <p style="color:black">&emsp;This month, we focus on <b>drug discovery and development</b> —a field that has evolved from the use of medicinal plants to the accidental discovery of antibiotics and, today, leveraging AI to accelerate the process.<br/>
		&emsp;AI is proving to be a game-changer in this field. A recent  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135964462400134X?via%3Dihub"><b>study</b></a> highlights its effectiveness in clinical trials, stating: <i>“Our analysis suggests that, in Phase I trials, AI-derived molecules can have a success rate of 80–90%, which is substantially higher success rates than historic averages.”</i></p>
                <p style="color:black">&emsp;Another example of AI’s impact in the field is last year’s <b>Nobel Prize in Chemistry, awarded to David Baker, Demis Hassabis, and John Jumper for their work on AlphaFold2</b>, a tool that revolutionized protein structure prediction.<br/>
			&emsp;Understanding protein structures is quite essential for drug discovery and has many other applications, making this a milestone achievement.<br/>
			&emsp;You can read all about last year's Nobel Prize for Chemistry <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/">here</a>.</p>
		<p style="color:black">&emsp;There is an extended <a href="https://fabit.unibo.it/en/research/research-areas/identification-and-development-of-drugs">list</a> of research groups at our university that are contributing to this area, so we are certain you’ll find something that interests you.
